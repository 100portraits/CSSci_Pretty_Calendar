# CSSci Pretty Calendar

This project is a web application built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) that modifies calendar files in `.ics` format. It allows users to input a calendar URL, and in return, they get a modified calendar that suits their needs better.

## Project Overview

The Calendar Modifier app helps you simplify your calendar by filtering out irrelevant events and focusing on what's important. It processes `.ics` calendar links and provides a subscription link to the modified version of the calendar.

## How to Use the App

You can use the Calendar Modifier app directly on my website. Here’s how it works:

1. **Get your calendar URL:**
   - Obtain the subscription link of your calendar from your calendar provider (e.g., Rooster).
   
2. **Visit the App:**
   - Go to [Calendar Modifier app](https://lukaspesek.com) and paste the subscription link into the input field.
   
3. **Generate Subscription Link:**
   - Once you submit the calendar URL, the app processes it and provides you with a new subscription link for your modified calendar.

4. **Add to Your Calendar Application:**
   - Use the subscription link in your preferred calendar app (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook) to enjoy your filtered and modified calendar view.
